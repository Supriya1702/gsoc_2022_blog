So, after looking into the hapi.py  and its functionalities I got to know that after passing extra paramters like 'gamma_CO2', 'n_CO2' for a specific molecule like CO
We can obtain these attributes in a comma separated manner in the CO.data file obtained.
Also, these extra columns are added in the 'extra' part of header file
```
from hapi import *

db_begin('data') #provide file location

fetch('CO',5,1,1,40000,Parameters=['gamma_CO2,'n_CO2'])
```

CO.data 
![data](./CO_data.png)

CO.header
![header](./CO_header.png)


For accessing these extra columns one needs to make use of `getColumn()` (for single column) or `getColumns()`(for multiple columns) and they can easily
get these values which are in the .data file in a comma-separated fashion.

Dr. Erwan then mentioned that it's time to add these new columns in Radis. What I should do is make it possible to fetch extra parameters in the local Radis hitran dataframe.
Now I had to integrate fetching extra columns and getColumn() into fetch_hitran() method first.

I went through  the fetch_hitran() function  of RADIS, so basically we would need to add Parameters =['gamma_CO2','n_CO2'] field in the function.....this would be then passed into fetch() function.
I had observed that when we execute fetch_hitran('molecule') ->then in `.radisdb` a temp file downloads__can_be_deleted gets created in which all isotopes of the molecule are downloaded(.data and .header file) then this is converted into hdf5 format.
There is also this columns_2004 which contains name, format, type and description of all the columns. So, we need to add the extra columns in this too.

columns_2004 = OrderedDict(  <br/>
    [
        # name    # format # type  # description                                 # unit<br/>
        ("id", ("a2", int, "Molecular number", "")),<br/>
        ("iso", ("a1", int, "isotope number", "")),<br/>
        ("wav", ("a12", float, "vacuum wavenumber", "cm-1")),<br/>
        ("int", ("a10", float, "intensity at 296K", "cm-1/(molecule/cm-2)")),<br/>
        ("A", ("a10", float, "Einstein A coefficient", "s-1")),<br/>
        ("airbrd", ("a5", float, "air-broadened half-width at 296K", "cm-1.atm-1")),<br/>
        ("selbrd", ("a5", float, "self-broadened half-width at 296K", "cm-1.atm-1")),<br/>
        ("El", ("a10", float, "lower-state energy", "cm-1")),<br/>
        ("Tdpair", ("a4", float, "temperature-dependance exponent for Gamma air", "")),<br/>
        ("Pshft", ("a8", float, "air pressure-induced line shift at 296K", "cm-1.atm-1")),<br/>
        ("globu", ("a15", str, "electronic and vibrational global upper quanta", "")),<br/>
        ("globl", ("a15", str, "electronic and vibrational global lower quanta", "")),<br/>
        ("locu", ("a15", str, "electronic and vibrational local upper quanta", "")),<br/>
        ("locl", ("a15", str, "electronic and vibrational local lower quanta", "")),<br/>
        ("ierr", ("a6", str, "ordered list of indices corresponding to uncertainty estimates of transition parameters", "")),<br/>
        ("iref", ("a12", str, "ordered list of reference identifiers for transition parameters", "")),<br/>
        ("lmix", ("a1", str, "flag indicating the presence of additional data and code relating to line-mixing", "")),<br/>
        ("gp", ("a7", float, "upper state degeneracy", "")),<br/>
        ("gpp", ("a7", float, "lower state degeneracy", "")),<br/>
    ]<br/>
)<br/>
""" OrderedDict: parsing order of HITRAN 2004 format """<br/>

But there was one issue with adding extra columns details in columns_2004 that these details were not present in the .header file like the other basic columns.

Also  I was going through the various scenarios :
1.When a user doesn't have any data then :
->download all possible columns into a single hdf5 file.
->have a main(base) hdf5 comprising of all basic params required to calculate spectrum and then we have 2 options to append files either have separate hdf5 files for every necessary parameter to calculate non-air diluent ( 'radisdb\...\_CO_extra_CO2gamma.hdf5 ) or append all these parameters into the base hdf5 file.
2. when data already exists on system:
->have a main(base) hdf5 comprising of all basic params required to calculate spectrum and then we have 2 options to append files either have separate hdf5 files for every necessary parameter to calculate non-air diluent ( 'radisdb\...\_CO_extra_CO2gamma.hdf5 ) or append all these parameters into the base hdf5 file.
Whenever we want to fetch these extra parameters the base(original) parameters are also fetched.....hence, we're not able to individually fetch a single or multiple parameters without the basic/original parameters which is equivalent to recreating the whole database.
Either we can have all these columns and fetch only the necessary columns from .data and create a new `hdf5 `file or append it into the main hdf5 file.
