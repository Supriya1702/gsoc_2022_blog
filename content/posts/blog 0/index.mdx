This is going to be a series of blogs where I will cover my Summer Journey with Radis organization as a part of Google Summer of Code. Welcome to my first blog where I will be introducing myself coz that is kind of necessary :p.
I am Supriya Kumari, currently a Software Engineer at HSBC (Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) Pune ,India working specifically in the Global Banking and Markets division with the Regulatory Data Service Team that is responsible for managing the Client Onboarding Lifecycle for different clients on basis of various applicable regulations.

I graduated in 2021 with a degree in Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering from Manav Rachna International Institute of Research and Studies, Faridabad being the gold medalist for scoring the highest GPA in BTech CSE and securing Rank 1
.Currently I'm also a Developer/Contributor at OpenAstronomy organization as a part of Google Summer of Code 2021.

Also one huge shout out to the guys at GatsbyJS for providing such an amazing blogging template(keep it simple and clean, they say!). The biggest advantage of this template is that every blog is written in Markdown. So its gives alot of flexibility and functionality to the user to edit their texts. Plus their templates codebase is easy to understand so anyone can just clone and get started!

Anyways I guess this should wrap up this blog. See you in the next one where I will be starting my GSoC journey and discuss my project ;)
Till then take care and ba-bye :)
