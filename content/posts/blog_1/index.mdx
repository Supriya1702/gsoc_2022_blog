Hello! This is going to be the second blog and first blog related to GSoC where I will be sharing my experience Community Bonding Period Experience with Radis. Before moving ahead lets learn about GSoC and my perspective about it.

Google Summer of Code
GSoC is a program conducted and funded by Google to promote college students around the world to engage with Open Source Community and contribute to the organization for a tenure of 3 months. In the process, code is created and released for the world to see and use. But the main aim of GSoC is to promote students to stick to the organizations and help to grow the Open Source Community. This is a great initiative by Google that brings thousands of students every year and help them get an opportunity to peek into the world of open source development, learn new skills and also get compensated for the work, quite generously.

I got to know about GSoC very late around my final year so couldn't apply in final year as I was already overwhelmed with projects, placements and internships at that time. But fast forwarding it to next year 2022 I was prepared enough this time and I feel priviledged to be a part of GSoC as part of OpenAstronomy.

My GSoC Project : Non-Air-Diluent
I'm part of Radis organization which is a sub-org of OpenAstronomy. Radis is a line-by-line code for creating high-resolution infrared molecular spectra, as well as a post-processing library for analyzing spectral lines. It can create both equilibrium and non-equilibrium absorption and emission spectra for multiple molecular species.

A line-by-line code like Radis means it calculates each spectral line from the absorbing or emitting molecule, taking into account the effects of temperature and pressure. We don't get a discrete line as a result of these parameters, but rather a shape with a width. The RADIS code was created to characterize plasma, flame, and atmosphere radiation, where a spectrum can be composed of many millions of lines. It uses a new algorithm to calculate high-temperature infrared spectra from databases with tens of millions of lines, making it one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. 

Currently, in RADIS all calculations are done assuming that the molecule is present in air diluent. RADIS currently supports the calculation of nearly every possible molecule, but by default assumes that it is diluted in air. The project goal is to automate it and expand it to multiple diluents (for instance: CO diluted in CO2 and H2O).

Community Bonding Period
The first phase of GSoC is the Community Bonding Period which is a 3 weeks long period. Its main aim is allow the student to get familiar with the community and the codebase. It serves as a warm-up period before the coding period. The first thing I did was that I went though the original Radis paper. It helped me understand the main purpose of RADIS, its architecture. I believed inorder to get myself ready for the coding period, I shall focus on solving some related issues to make me more familiar with the codebase like I went through Spectroscopy101 tutorial notebook and Radis paper to learn more about broadening, its types, parameters affecting it etc. I even generated a Pull request that got merged for solving some bugs in the code itself https://github.com/radis/spectro101/pull/9.


In short, the Community Bonding Period has been great and I have learned alot about Radis during this time. In the next 2 weeks I will be focusing  more on HAPI manual and hapi.py to get myself familiar with  its codebase and required methods to get Broadening coefficients and calculate spectrum in diluents other than self and air.

Im really looking forward to the upcoming months and I know that this summer is going to be an enriching  experience and I'm really looking forward to do amazing things for the community and want to thank Google, OpenAstronomy, Radis and my mentors Erwan Pannier, Anand Kumar for this opportunity.
