Now since fetching of extra columns which includes broadening coeffcients was completed I had to pull the the fetch_hitran_update changes into non_air_diluent_2 branch
and started working on top of that.

This PR https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/495 <br/>

  1) Modifying calc_spectrum and SpectrumFactory to add diluent parameter<br/>
  2) Updated pressure_broadening_HWHM for non-air diluents<br/>
  3) Added broadening coefficient list<br/>
