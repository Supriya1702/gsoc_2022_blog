Dr. Erwan and Mr. Anand (my mentors) suggested since my Non-Air Diluent project was getting large I should first create a separate PR for
fetch_hitran() changes and then after merging these changes I should carry on with the changes for calculating spectrum for a molcule in non-air Diluent
which had changes in calc.py, broadening.py, loader.py etc.

So, I created PR https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/505  and after a lot of iterations it passed all test cases finally got merged!.
This was my first PR for this project that was merged.<br>
*This PR basically addressed:<br>
  *Replacing hit2df with LOCAL_TABLE_CACHE<br>
  *added a parameter extra_params in fetch_hitran() and dbmanager.py<br>
  *downloading all columns when extra_params = 'all'<br>
  *Adding conditions to raise AccuracyWarning when All columns are not downloaded currently.<br>
  *cleaning of NaN value columns after downloading all columns in hdf5.py<br>
  *Modularized code by creating new function post_process_hitran_data for parsing non-equilibrium parameters<br>
  *added ldb.get_columns function<br>
  *Added test for get_columns in test_hdf5.py and some minor changes<br>


after running :
```
from radis.io.hitran import fetch_hitran
df = fetch_hitran("CO", extra_params="all", cache="regen") #regen to regenerate file
print(df.columns)
```
you'll get these columns--> the Nan value columns are removed to save disk space which means out of 78 only the below columns have values for
CO molcule
