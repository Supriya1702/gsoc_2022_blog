The coding period begins! Now, it's time for us contributors to pull up our socks and dive into coding.
Firstly, my task for Non-Air Diluent project was to somehow get the broadening coeffcients for a specific 
molecule using HAPI.
I started off by the reading the HAPI manual to understand the functioning of HAPI. It was structured properly
and I started implementing the code as well to understand it properly.
First to use any functionlity of hapi we need to use `from hapi import *` (for importing all fucntions, we can mention any particulr one too).
To start working with HAPI, the user should import all functions from the module “hapi.py”:

First, let's choose a folder for our local database. Every time you start your Python project, you have to 
specify explicitly the name of the database folder db_begin('data')
So, let's download some data from the server and do some processing on it. Suppose that we want to 
get line-by-line data on the main isotopologue of H2O.
For retrieving the data to the local database, the user has to specify the following parameters:
1) Name of the local table which will store the downloaded data.
2) Either a pair of molecule and isotopologue HITRAN numbers (M and I), or a "global" isotopologue 
ID (iso_id).
3) Wavenumber range (nu_min and nu_max)
N.B. If you specify a name which already exists in your local folder, the existing table with that name 
will be overwritten.
To learn about the table we just downloaded, let's use a function "describeTable".

The local data is downloaded from the HITRANonline portal (http://hitran.org) using API functions 
(fetch and fetch_by_ids). Downloaded data is stored in the folder which was specified in a call to 
db_begin().
The structure of a local data folder is as follows (assuming that you have already downloaded several 
tables from HITRANonline):
Folder name<br />
 | <br />
 |----- table1.data<br />
 | table1.header<br />
 |<br />
 |----- table2.data<br />
 | table2.header<br />
…<br />
 |----- tableN.data<br />
 tableN.header<br />

The typical format is as follows: <table_name>.data for line-by-line data, and <table_name>.header
for table description (field names and positions, format, number of lines etc...). The default file format 
is 160-character HITRAN format
